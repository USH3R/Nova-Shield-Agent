## 💡 Executive Overview
NovaShield is a multimodal AI agent powered by **Amazon Nova 2 Sonic**. It automates the gap between physical security and digital audit trails, specifically designed for deployment within **AWS GovCloud (US)**.

### ⚙️ Core Functions
1. **Multimodal Analysis:** Uses Nova 2 visual reasoning to detect unauthorized hardware implants.
2. **Autonomous Triage:** Evaluates real-time threats against the **NIST 800-53** control catalog.
3. **Polyglot Execution:** A three-tier software stack (Python, Java, C++) that handles reasoning, enterprise auditing, and hardware-level lockdown.

### 🧪 Technical Mathematical Integrity
To ensure Zero-Trust verification, NovaShield utilizes Bayesian probability for threat detection:
\\[ P(T|S) = \frac{P(S|T)P(T)}{P(S)} \\]

## 🚀 How to Run the NovaShield Demo
This application provides a simulated AWS audit.

How to Run the Application  

    1. Run in GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)  
    Open this repository on GitHub.  
    Click Code → Codespaces → Create Codespace on main.  
    Wait for the environment to load.  
    Open the terminal inside Codespaces.  
    Run:         bash demo.sh  
    When the server starts, open the browser, or open the Port tab and then open forwarded port (usually 8050), to view the dashboard.  

   2. Run Manually Inside the Repository (Local Machine)  
    If you downloaded or cloned the repository:  
    Open a terminal.  
    Navigate to the project folder.  
    Example:                                          cd HACKATHON-Nova-Shield-Agent-Amazon-Nova-AI-Hackathon  
    Run the launcher:                            bash demo.sh  
    Open your browser and go to:        http://localhost:8050  

    3. If You Are Using a Random Public Terminal  
    Public terminals do not automatically have this project. You must first download or clone the repository.  
    A. Option A — Clone with Git  
    Type:  
            git clone https://github.com/USH3R/HACKATHON-Nova-Shield-Agent-Amazon-Nova-AI-Hackathon.git  
            cd HACKATHON-Nova-Shield-Agent-Amazon-Nova-AI-Hackathon  
            bash demo.sh  
    B. Option B — Download ZIP  
    Click Code → Download ZIP on GitHub.  
    Extract the folder from the ZIP file. Then,  
    Open a terminal in that folder. Run / Type:         bash demo.sh  

    4. Quick Start Command  
    This command is only for use inside a Terminal (like the one in Codespaces, terminal, or on your local machine).  
    Verify Your Location: Ensure your terminal is currently pointed at the project directory;  
    You should see HACKATHON-Nova-Shield-Agent-Amazon-Nova-AI-Hackathon in your command prompt.  
    If you have already performed the setup in steps 1, 2, or 3 and just need to restart the application, type:  
            bash demo.sh  

- No AWS credentials are needed.
